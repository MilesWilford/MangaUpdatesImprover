WIP - MangaUpdates Improver

This is a userscript that should be installable in any browser.  Using some simple jQuery, it strips away bogus, ugly content from the website at mangaupdates/releases.html

I intend to further develop it to load group and page info pages in line in some way, and possibly entirely re-display content in a more pleasing format.

God MangaUpdates has a bad site.  Uses tables for layouts and has nil semantics.  It's a pain targetting its elements properly.

More to come.
