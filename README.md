WIP - MangaUpdates Improver

This is a userscript that should be installable in any browser.  Using some simple jQuery, it puts a simplified content overlay over the site at mangaupdates.com/releases.html with a cleaner display.

It will open manga pages and group pages in line.  It's not a responsive design and is pretty ugly, but it's still more usable than the mangaupdates page.

God MangaUpdates has a bad site.  Uses tables for layouts and has nil semantics.  It's a pain targetting its elements properly.

More to come.
