WIP - MangaUpdates Improver

This is a userscript that should be installable in any browser.  Using some simple jQuery, it puts a simplified content overlay over the site at mangaupdates.com/releases.html with a cleaner display.

I intend to further develop it to load group and page info pages in line in some way.

God MangaUpdates has a bad site.  Uses tables for layouts and has nil semantics.  It's a pain targetting its elements properly.

More to come.
